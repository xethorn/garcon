Activity
========

Activities are self generated classes to which you can pass an identifier,
and a list of tasks to perform. The activities are in between the decider and
the tasks.

For ease, two types of task runners are available: Sync and Async. If
you need something more specific, you should either create your own runner, or
you should create a main task that will then split the work.

Create an activity::

    import boto3
    from garcon import activity

    # First step is to create the workflow on a specific domain.
    client = boto3.client('swf')
    create = activity.create(client, 'domain', 'workflow-name')

    initial_activity = create(
        # Name of your activity
        name='activity_name',

        # List of tasks to run (here we use the Sync runner)
        run=runner.Sync(task1),

        # No requires since it's the first one. Later in your flow, if you have
        # a dependency, just use the variable that contains the activity.
        requires=[],

        # If the activity fails, number of times you want to retry.
        retry=0,

        # If you want to run the activity `n` times, you can use a generator.
        generator=[generator_name])
